        The book begins with an attack by a number of Dementors against Harry and Dudley on Privet Drive. Harry is very nearly expelled for his unauthorized use of magic in the Muggle world, but of course, he also has some great school leaders who come to bat for him. He learns about a secret order of wizards and witches that exists to fight against evil (the Order of the Phoenix).

            To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee has a strong sense of morality at the center of its story. The characters are well-written and slightly unconventional. The hero of the story is Atticus Finch; he is not a hero in a traditional sense due to his physical traits, but he is a hero because of his values. I am glad I re-read this book.
