            The book begins with an attack by a number of Dementors against Harry and Dudley on Privet Drive. Harry is
            very nearly expelled for his unauthorized use of magic in the Muggle world, but of course, he also has some
            great school leaders who come to bat for him. He learns about a secret order of wizards and witches that
            exists to fight against evil (the Order of the Phoenix).

            The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new
            world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre
            and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie
            experience all the more miraculous.

                    To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee has a strong sense of morality at the center of its story. The
                    characters are well-written and slightly unconventional. The hero of the story is Atticus Finch; he
                    is not a hero in a traditional sense due to his physical traits, but he is a hero because of his
                    values. I am glad I re-read this book.

                    Don Quixote has become so entranced by reading chivalric romances that he determines to become a
                    knight-errant himself. In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in
                    all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray—he tilts at windmills,
                    imagining them to be giants—Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity.

                    offering a path for personal growth and self-mastery.

It not only embraces a language of critique and possibility but relies on the narratives of teachers who are working together to reclaim schools as sites of struggle and empowerment.
